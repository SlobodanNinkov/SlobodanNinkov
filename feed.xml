<p id="ember700">The goal was to research the consequences of the upcoming chip technologies. The text below is the result of a short conversation with KIMI K2 0905 LLM.</p>
<p id="ember701" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">It reads as a mix of future history, futurism, and a list of completely alien technologies.</p>
<p id="ember702" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">TEXT:</p>
<p id="ember703" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">These five fabrics—open RISC-V, neuromorphic, photonic, FPGA, and quantum—do not just change what we compute; they change the <em>cost structure of reality</em>. Below, the long-wave civilisational story is told as five <em>phase transitions</em>, each with a tipping metric and a societal symptom you will <em>feel</em> in daily life.</p>
<hr class="reader-divider-block__horizontal-rule">
<h3 id="ember704" class="ember-view reader-text-block__heading-3">Phase 1 (2026-2032) “Cent-per-device”</h3>
<p id="ember705" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">Tipping metric One useful RISC-V + neuromorphic chiplet falls below <strong>1 ¢/unit</strong> in 28 nm legacy fabs.</p>
<p id="ember706" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">Civil symptom</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Dust gets a nervous system</em>. Every yoghurt lid, tennis shoe insole, and letter in the post carries a 1 mm² “sense&amp;spike” sticker that learns <em>your</em> micro-environment (gait, spoilage gases, tamper) and whispers a 100 nW spike-stream to the nearest photonic router. Insurance flips from <em>damage reimbursement</em> to <em>pre-crime reward</em>: leave the milk out, get a push-message <em>before</em> it spoils.</li>
<li>The <em>right to be unread</em> becomes a constitutional issue—because objects now <em>out-remember</em> you.</li>
</ul>
<p id="ember707" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph"></p>
<hr class="reader-divider-block__horizontal-rule">
<h3 id="ember708" class="ember-view reader-text-block__heading-3">Phase 2 (2030-2038) “Cent-per-TeraSyn”</h3>
<p id="ember709" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">Tipping metric Energy to perform 10¹² <em>useful</em> synaptic updates drops below <strong>1 J</strong> (≈ 1 heartbeat).</p>
<p id="ember710" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">Civil symptom</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Cities become predictive organisms</em>. Traffic lights, sewers, cafeteria coffee machines run a single distributed neuromorphic net that <em>dreams</em> the city 30 s ahead. Jay-walking literally re-routes a delivery van two blocks away; humans adapt by “walking politely” to save collective energy—an emergent Etiquette 2.0 enforced by <em>thermodynamic politeness</em>.</li>
<li>Democracy mutates into <em>predictive governance</em>: citizens vote on <em>simulated futures</em> rendered in real-time. The ballot question is no longer “Do you want policy X?” but “Do you want the 17:15 simulation branch?”</li>
</ul>
<p id="ember711" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph"></p>
<hr class="reader-divider-block__horizontal-rule">
<h3 id="ember712" class="ember-view reader-text-block__heading-3">Phase 3 (2035-2043) “Cent-per-logical-qubit”</h3>
<p id="ember713" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">Tipping metric One logical qubit-hour costs <strong>&lt; 1 ¢ of electricity</strong> at consumer prices.</p>
<p id="ember714" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">Civil symptom</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Consensus reality forks</em>. A teenager generates a thousand <em>entanglement-certified</em> fake video-streams per night; the cryptographic cost to <em>disprove</em> each is higher than the cost to create them. “Seeing is believing” is replaced by <em>Bell-inequality receipts</em>; eye-witness testimony becomes <em>legally inadmissible</em> without a quantum provenance tag.</li>
<li><strong>Science turns into a subscription</strong>: universities that cannot afford 10 k logical qubits fall behind <em>discovery velocity</em>. The haves run variational quantum simulators that brute-force new antibiotics in days; the have-nots watch YouTube explainers of drugs they cannot synthesise.</li>
</ul>
<p id="ember715" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph"></p>
<hr class="reader-divider-block__horizontal-rule">
<h3 id="ember716" class="ember-view reader-text-block__heading-3">Phase 4 (2040-2048) “Cent-per-truth-bit”</h3>
<p id="ember717" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">Tipping metric A <em>globally entangled</em> bit (Earth-scale Bell test) can be minted for <strong>1 ¢</strong>.</p>
<p id="ember718" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">Civil symptom</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Money becomes a heat sink</strong>. The new reserve currency is <em>entropy debt</em>: every transaction must include a <em>negative-entropy certificate</em>—proof that you removed 1 bit of uncorrelated noise from the planet-wide entanglement mesh. Economists speak of <em>exa-Bell</em> reserves; the IMF stores qubits in orbit instead of gold.</li>
<li><strong>Wars move to the cryostat</strong>. Sabotaging an adversary’s dilution refrigerator is the 21-st century equivalent of bombing a gasoline depot; whole countries harden their <em>quantum bunkers</em> at −269 °C.</li>
</ul>
<p id="ember719" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph"></p>
<hr class="reader-divider-block__horizontal-rule">
<h3 id="ember720" class="ember-view reader-text-block__heading-3">Phase 5 (2045-∞ ) “Cent-per-reality”</h3>
<p id="ember721" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">Tipping metric Cost to synthesise a <em>complete sensory reality</em> (visual, acoustic, haptic, olfactory) indistinguishable from physics <em>in vivo</em> falls below <strong>1 ¢ per perceived hour</strong>.</p>
<p id="ember722" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">Civil symptom</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Civilisation splits into </strong><strong><em>Continualists</em></strong><strong> and </strong><strong><em>Base-liners</em></strong>. Continualists spend 99 % of their subjective lifetime inside entanglement-verified simulations that run 10 000× faster than biology; governments grant <em>quantum asylum</em>—the right to pause your body while your mind lives a subjective century in a data-centre at 10 mK.</li>
<li><strong>The UN declares </strong><strong><em>Planetary Identity Day</em></strong>: for 24 h all quantum, neuromorphic, photonic and consensus services are globally switched off to force every human to re-calibrate to base reality. It becomes the most hated—then most sacred—holiday of the year.</li>
</ul>
<p id="ember723" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph"></p>
<hr class="reader-divider-block__horizontal-rule">
<h3 id="ember724" class="ember-view reader-text-block__heading-3">Net civilisational shift: from “scarcity of atoms” to “scarcity of certified reality”</h3>
<p id="ember725" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">The five fabrics together drive the marginal cost of:</p>
<ul>
<li>sensing → <strong>0</strong> (dust does it)</li>
<li>cognition → <strong>0</strong> (neuro + photonic + FPGA)</li>
<li>universes → <strong>0</strong> (quantum sampling + simulation)</li>
</ul>
<p id="ember726" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph"></p>
<p id="ember727" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">Hence the only scarce good left is <em>trust that a signal originated in a physical world you share with others</em>. Politics, religion, markets and even romance reorganise around <em>attestation rituals</em>—ceremonies whose purpose is to consume <em>exactly enough</em> energy/entropy that forging them would cost more than the social benefit of the lie.</p>
<p id="ember728" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">The final paradox: we are building a civilisation whose most valuable commodity is the <em>thermodynamic signature</em> that proves something <em>really happened</em>—and we need refrigerators cooled to millikelvin, chips that speak light, and brains made of spikes to produce that proof.</p>
<p id="ember729" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">Civilisation becomes a planet-sized notary, running on light, spikes, qubits and open silicon—forever stamping reality so that tomorrow can still tell the difference between a story and a fact.</p>

                <p class="first:mt-1.5">IoT device initial field testing is a special moment in the product lifecycle. During this phase, the team receives brutal, reality-based feedback on technical decisions made during development.</p>
<p class="first:mt-1.5">The short list below captures practical know‑how that will hopefully save you time. It originates from multiple discussions with peers about how to run a field test.</p>
<p class="first:mt-1.5">These lists are written from the perspective of a team lead responsible for successful test execution.</p>
<h4>Preparations for the trip</h4>
<ul class="list-disc">
<li class="ml-4">Develop a test plan. What are you testing? What outcomes do you expect?</li>
<li class="ml-4">Get the budget approved, or scope the test so it can be self‑financed by the team lead.</li>
<li class="ml-4">Check legal constraints (e.g., drone flight restrictions, permitted frequencies, spectrum licenses).</li>
<li class="ml-4">Choose the test location and, if possible, contact local responsible parties.</li>
<li class="ml-4">Review the location on maps; understand access roads, nearest houses, gas stations, and shops.</li>
<li class="ml-4">Arrange transportation.</li>
<li class="ml-4">Arrange food and water.</li>
<li class="ml-4">Prepare a parts checklist. Double‑check everything; assume you’ll forget something.</li>
<li>Visualize the test from start to the end, missing cables, faulty cables, etc.</li>
<li class="ml-4">Bring repair and test tools.</li>
<li class="ml-4">Bring spare devices if possible. Devices tend to fail once you’re 50+ km from the lab.</li>
<li class="ml-4">Charge all batteries or bring a generator. If bringing a generator, don’t forget fuel and a power inverter (DC-to-AC).</li>
<li class="ml-4">Prepare sun protection: shade, hats, sunscreen.</li>
<li class="ml-4">Avoid food that could upset your stomach the day before and during testing.</li>
<li class="ml-4">Brief your superiors on the plan so they’re aware of the day’s activities.</li>
<li class="ml-4">Keep phone numbers for your boss and legal on hand; prepare a brief explanation in case law enforcement inquires.</li>
<li class="ml-4">Brief all team members on what you’ll do, why, and how—avoid on‑site debates.</li>
<li class="ml-4">Plan data collection methods and formats.</li>
<li class="ml-4">Bring cables, spare cables, and spare tested cables.</li>
<li class="ml-4">Wear appropriate workwear and sturdy shoes.</li>
</ul>
<h4>During the testing</h4>
<ul class="list-disc">
<li class="ml-4">Prioritize safety.</li>
<li class="ml-4">Ensure every team member understands their responsibilities.</li>
<li class="ml-4">Double‑check time synchronization across all relevant clocks/devices.</li>
<li class="ml-4">Prepare spreadsheets/templates for manual data collection.</li>
<li class="ml-4">Enable photo timestamps/metadata on phones and verify it works.</li>
<li class="ml-4">Execute the test plan and collect all data. Double‑check entries and logs.</li>
<li class="ml-4">Expect reduced cognitive capacity under field stress, especially in early tests—keep procedures simple, explicit, and straightforward.</li>
<li class="ml-4">Field‑savvy team members (e.g., with military experience) can be invaluable, particularly when technically inclined.</li>
<li class="ml-4">Duplicate the directory with test results to a second location on the computer.</li>
<li class="ml-4">Include at least one first‑time user (who matches the user profile); observe for priceless UX insights.</li>
</ul>
<h4>After the test (same day)</h4>
<ul class="list-disc">
<li class="ml-4">Pack up everything and double‑check you’ve got it all.</li>
<li class="ml-4">Clean the area; use available trash cans or carry waste out. Do not litter.</li>
<li class="ml-4">Debrief during the return trip. Tired feedback is candid—capture it.</li>
<li class="ml-4">Write a short day summary: what went right, what went wrong, improvements, device issues, and any observations. Save it with the test results.</li>
<li class="ml-4">Copy all phone images to the test results directory.</li>
<li class="ml-4">Back up the test results directory to the company servers.</li>
<li class="ml-4">Inform your superior that the test is complete; share a summary and commit to a full report tomorrow.</li>
<li class="ml-4">Confirm that no one was left in the field.</li>
</ul>
<h4>The day after testing</h4>
<ul class="list-disc">
<li class="ml-4">Write the full report based on data and feedback.</li>
<li class="ml-4">Review results with stakeholders (team, product owner/manager, etc.).</li>
<li>Submit receipts for food and transportation to accounting.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Notes and optional enhancements</h3>
<ul class="list-disc">
<li class="ml-4">Add a preflight “Go/No‑Go” checklist: weather, permits in hand, site access confirmed, critical spares present.</li>
<li class="ml-4">Time sync: specify a standard (e.g., NTP server, GPS time) and require a sync check at start and mid‑test.</li>
<li class="ml-4">Data schema: define exact filenames, metadata fields, and folder structure before the trip to avoid chaos later.</li>
<li class="ml-4">Risk register: list top 5 risks (power, comms, interference, mechanical, environmental) with mitigations.</li>
<li class="ml-4">Incident protocol: who leads, who contacts legal/PR, what to say, what not to say.</li>
<li class="ml-4">EHS specifics: PPE list, heat/cold plans, first‑aid kit, nearest emergency room, site hazard brief.</li>
<li class="ml-4">RF/EMI: if applicable, bring a spectrum snapshot tool and document ambient conditions pre/post test.</li>

                <p>We don’t talk enough about failures on here. Feeds are full of “I’ve accepted an offer” and funding announcements. Here’s a quieter perspective from the silent majority—maybe it helps someone.<br><br>Context: I tried to build a startup based on “simulated field usage and testing”. The need is real: in product development with field testing, simulation can be far cheaper than running systems in the field.<br><br>What I learned:<br><br><strong>- Paperwork is real</strong><br>Starting, running, and closing a company means lawyers, auditors, filings. <br>They’re friendly—but they get paid whether you sink or swim. Budget for them. As a limited company, expect at least annual director responsibilities and audits.<br><br><strong>- Be clear: product or service</strong><br>Product = you sell a thing. Service = you sell time/knowledge. I tried “product with customization.” It muddied the message and confused customers.<br><br><strong>- The EU favors products</strong><br>Services don’t scale easily; policy and incentives often lean toward product companies.<br><br><strong>- GDPR is not optional</strong><br>If your site has logins, you’re under GDPR. Competitors may report you. Compliance and cybersecurity are real costs and responsibilities—almost a separate business function.<br><br><strong>- Anything near defense has its own gravity</strong><br>Different rules, long procurement cycles, relationship-driven. The system favors big, slow incumbents. Connections matter.<br><br><strong>- Distribution beats almost everything</strong><br>If you crack marketing and sales, you can rent development and still build a product.<br><br><strong>- TAM isn’t what you think</strong><br>Your “imagined” market and your “accessible” market are different. Validate the reachable slice.<br><br><strong>- Technical excellence ≠ traction</strong><br>Without sales and marketing, craftsmanship doesn’t move the needle.<br><br>!!! Important takeaways:<br>- Nail the product messaging. Clear &gt; clever.<br>- Make the value obvious to people who aren’t already problem-aware. “This is how we do things” inertia is your real competitor.<br><br>If you’re working on something similar (simulation, field testing, regulated markets), I'd be happy to compare notes.</p>

                <p class="first:mt-1.5">This short essay is inspired by my job in the State Lottery of Serbia between May 2005 and May 2012. In the essay, I tried to summarize how the state lottery's Information System (IS) evolved.</p>
<p class="first:mt-1.5">First steps were manual report generation—the data analyst way. Unfortunately, this wasn’t feasible given the number and frequency of reports. Management wanted to track sales in real time.</p>
<p class="first:mt-1.5">Next, we generated reports against live data. At the time, it seemed like a great idea, but we quickly learned you can’t have both fast inserts (from 1000s of POS machines) and fast queries (needed for reports) on the same database. Every report request from anyone in the building slowed down the data server.</p>
<p class="first:mt-1.5">That’s when we learned why there is wisdom in splitting data access into OLTP and OLAP databases.</p>
<p class="first:mt-1.5">Our second phase was nightly automated data parsing and loading, preparing data for reports. Management still wanted some data in real time, so we implemented what was essentially our own early map-reduce–style pipeline. Real-time data was parsed and handled, and any report requiring real-time info hit very small tables that were updated multiple times per second.</p>
<p class="first:mt-1.5">Over time, these reports and the web pages hosting them spread across the company, and everyone could see everything. Unsurprisingly, top management didn’t love the idea that the coffee lady could check company earnings. The solution was to integrate all these separate pages into a single application with login, permissions, and proper security.</p>
<p class="first:mt-1.5">After integration, we faced an endless stream of requests for additional reports from every corner of the company. In addition to the nightly ETL and report preparation, we also developed new lottery games and integrated our system with external customers. All of this effort just accelerated the proliferation of reports.</p>
<p class="first:mt-1.5">Eventually, top management was saturated with dashboards and conflicting KPIs. The business decision was to focus on a single set of KPIs aligned with company goals, instead of ad hoc metrics defined by each department. This effort created a unified web-based Information System with a standardized set of reports.</p>
<p class="first:mt-1.5">A few years down the line, when sales started declining, Marketing and Sales began requesting reports that could be summarized as “compare everything to everything else” to try to find some light at the end of the tunnel. The only way to tame the explosion was self-service. We used Microsoft DW technology (SSAS and SSIS). With these tools, the dev team finally got ahead of the requests. The data warehouse was prepared nightly; processing took about six hours, with multiple redundancies and consistency checks.</p>
<p class="first:mt-1.5">The downside was that one Excel file became the new information system. Everyone felt in control and could do whatever they wanted. Some entrepreneurial colleagues built their own reports using data from the DW. Suddenly, we were scrambling across the company, trying to keep track of Excel versions.</p>
<p class="first:mt-1.5">After Excel’s introduction, we realized no one was logging into the IS anymore.</p>
<p class="first:mt-1.5">And hilariously, we found ourselves back where we started: the coffee lady complained about her salary after seeing how much money the company earned (while ignoring expenses). Trusting people not to share an Excel file is not a viable approach, even among top management.</p>
<p class="first:mt-1.5">We had to introduce permissions on DW tables to limit who could see what. The situation finally blew up when the CEO sent an Excel file with CEO-level privileges to Payments, and Payments accidentally forwarded the CEO Excel to Sales… and suddenly everyone had CEO-level access.</p>
<p class="first:mt-1.5">All this time, our chief IT guy was a Linux proponent, while the company ran Windows clients and a mix of Windows and Linux servers.</p>
<p class="first:mt-1.5">The Excel debacle was the final straw that gave the development team enough ammunition to push IT to adopt Active Directory. Introducing AD resolved the chaos around permissions and privileges. Suddenly, there was no need to log in to the IS; anyone could open any approved Excel file, and it worked out of the box.</p>
<p class="first:mt-1.5">It was a wild time. We were solving problems on the fly as systems ran and a 7-million-strong audience played games. There was no appetite to stop everything for a few days to roll out a new system; the only way to pause for a few hours was in the face of a significant crisis or breakdown.</p>
<p>Talking with a bunch of friends, it turned out that the observed sequence: manual → live on OLTP → split OLTP/OLAP → hybrid near-real-time → app consolidation → Excel self-service on SSAS → central IAM (AD), was similar to how many companies evolved in 2005–2012.</p>
<p class="first:mt-1.5">Today, most of this system could be implemented by one person, and all reporting could be handled with Power BI, Tableau, Qlik, or similar tools.</p>
