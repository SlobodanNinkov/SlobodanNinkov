                <p>We don’t talk enough about failures on here. Feeds are full of “I’ve accepted an offer” and funding announcements. Here’s a quieter perspective from the silent majority—maybe it helps someone.<br><br>Context: I tried to build a startup based on “simulated field usage and testing”. The need is real: in product development with field testing, simulation can be far cheaper than running systems in the field.<br><br>What I learned:<br><br><strong>- Paperwork is real</strong><br>Starting, running, and closing a company means lawyers, auditors, filings. <br>They’re friendly—but they get paid whether you sink or swim. Budget for them. As a limited company, expect at least annual director responsibilities and audits.<br><br><strong>- Be clear: product or service</strong><br>Product = you sell a thing. Service = you sell time/knowledge. I tried “product with customization.” It muddied the message and confused customers.<br><br><strong>- The EU favors products</strong><br>Services don’t scale easily; policy and incentives often lean toward product companies.<br><br><strong>- GDPR is not optional</strong><br>If your site has logins, you’re under GDPR. Competitors may report you. Compliance and cybersecurity are real costs and responsibilities—almost a separate business function.<br><br><strong>- Anything near defense has its own gravity</strong><br>Different rules, long procurement cycles, relationship-driven. The system favors big, slow incumbents. Connections matter.<br><br><strong>- Distribution beats almost everything</strong><br>If you crack marketing and sales, you can rent development and still build a product.<br><br><strong>- TAM isn’t what you think</strong><br>Your “imagined” market and your “accessible” market are different. Validate the reachable slice.<br><br><strong>- Technical excellence ≠ traction</strong><br>Without sales and marketing, craftsmanship doesn’t move the needle.<br><br>!!! Important takeaways:<br>- Nail the product messaging. Clear &gt; clever.<br>- Make the value obvious to people who aren’t already problem-aware. “This is how we do things” inertia is your real competitor.<br><br>If you’re working on something similar (simulation, field testing, regulated markets), I'd be happy to compare notes.</p>

            <![CDATA[
                <p>In the relentless march of technology and progress, artificial intelligence (AI) stands out as a pivotal innovation, reshaping the strategic landscapes of businesses, militaries, and governments alike. The emergence of AI as a critical tool in decision-making processes underscores a fundamental truth: technological advancements often arise from the urgent necessities of their times.</p>
<p>Historically, some of our most significant technological breakthroughs have their origins in the demands of high-stakes scenarios. The development of calculus was propelled by the need for precise artillery trajectory calculations. Similarly, the pursuit of atomic energy was initially driven by the quest to build more powerful weapons. Even the advent of modern computers can be traced back to military needs for improved trajectory calculations and code-breaking during wartime.</p>
<p>This pattern of innovation under pressure brings us to John Boyd, a military strategist whose concept of the OODA loop — Observe, Orient, Decide, Act — has become a cornerstone of effective strategy in both military and business contexts. The OODA loop encapsulates the essence of dynamic decision-making: the faster an entity can move through this cycle, the more advantageously it can position itself against competitors or adversaries.</p>
<p>In high-stakes environments, the primary objective is to expedite one’s OODA loop to outpace that of one’s adversaries. By achieving a quicker loop, an organization can dominate interactions by compelling its competitors to operate with outdated information, thus increasing their propensity for errors.</p>
<p>AI’s potential to enhance decision-making across strategic, operational, and tactical levels cannot be overstated. By integrating AI into the core of complex systems — whether they be corporate, military, or governmental — organizations can significantly shorten their OODA loops. This technological integration not only optimizes decision-making but also becomes a critical factor in maintaining competitive advantages in high-stakes scenarios.</p>
<p>However, the reliance on AI for decision-making is not without its consequences. As AI capabilities expand, there is an inevitable trend towards the escalation of its roles, potentially leading to a future where AI predominantly handles decisions to eliminate human biases and delays. Such a shift could profoundly transform the nature of decision-making, raising pivotal questions about the balance between human judgment and algorithmic efficiency.</p>
<h1><strong>Deep Simulation and Strategic Dominance</strong></h1>
<p>In an era where AI is central to strategic operations, the concept of AI entities simulating each other introduces a profound layer to warfare and competition. Two advanced AI systems, each tasked with decision-making, will inevitably engage in simulations to predict and exploit the other’s weaknesses. This recursive loop of simulation is aimed at digging deeper into the adversary’s strategy, refining its own responses in real-time. Such capability enables a form of warfare where battles are fought and won within virtual realms, even before manifesting in the physical world.</p>
<h1><strong>AI-Driven Military Operations</strong></h1>
<p>The strategic use of AI extends beyond simulation, influencing the very structure of military operations. Modern armies are evolving into extensions of the AI decision-making process, where every unit, vehicle, and soldier is part of a vast, interconnected network orchestrated by AI. This integration allows for unprecedented levels of coordination, efficiency, and speed in responses, effectively transforming military forces into highly responsive instruments of AI strategy.</p>
<h1><strong>The Geopolitical Implications of AI Adoption</strong></h1>
<p>The race towards AI dominance brings with it significant geopolitical consequences. Nations that fail to invest in AI technology risk falling drastically behind, not only in terms of military power but also in economic and political arenas. In this new paradigm, a country not actively developing and integrating AI is at risk of becoming a mere satellite to the more technologically advanced states, akin to a colony in terms of autonomy and influence. The stark reality is that in the competitive landscape of the future, lagging in AI integration equates to relinquishing control over one’s destiny.</p>
<p>In conclusion, as we continue to advance technologically, the integration of AI into strategic decision-making frameworks is not just beneficial but necessary. Those who fail to adopt this innovation risk falling behind, governed by slower, less effective decision-making processes. In the race for supremacy — be it economic, military, or political — the speed and accuracy of AI-enhanced decisions could very well determine the victors.</p>

                <p>This article explores strategies for enhancing intelligence and interpersonal skills, drawing on insights from the film ‘Revolver,’ particularly the version that emphasizes the role of the ego. Developed with a mix of original concepts and augmented by ChatGPT, it offers practical advice for improving your interactions with others and excelling in various aspects of life.</p>
<p>Please note that throughout this article, the term “<strong>game</strong>” refers to the concept from game theory, which encompasses interactions among people, computers, and various systems.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*2bbSeZSS52Q1MtXy3tZiYQ.png" alt="" data-is-external-image="true"></p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>In the intricate world of games and cons, understanding the dynamics between opponents and victims is crucial for mastering strategies that go beyond mere skill. This article explores the profound rules that govern every interaction, whether in a game or a con, revealing how these principles can apply not just within games but in our everyday lives as well.</p>
<p><strong>Rule 1: The Necessity of Stronger Opponents</strong></p>
<p>“The only way to get smarter is by playing smarter opponents.” This rule underpins the essence of growth, both personal and strategic. Challenging oneself against superior opponents not only sharpens skills but also deepens understanding, ensuring continuous learning and adaptation.</p>
<p><strong>Rule 2: The Complexity of the Game</strong></p>
<p>“The more sophisticated the game, the more sophisticated the opponent.” As the complexity of the game increases, so does the caliber of the opposition. This escalation requires not just better strategies but also heightened awareness and adaptability, calling for a deep dive into the nuances of both the game and the players.</p>
<p><strong>The Rules of the Con</strong></p>
<p>At the heart of every game and con is the dichotomy between the opponent and the victim. The rules of the con are designed to manipulate perceptions of control, gradually tightening the noose around the victim who is led to believe they are in charge, while in reality, they are being subtly dominated.</p>
<p>1. <strong>Perceived Control vs. Actual Control</strong>: The victim’s illusion of control is inversely proportional to their actual power within the game. As they sink deeper into the rules laid out for them, they relinquish more control, unwittingly sealing their fate.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Distraction Through Consumption</strong>: By engaging the victim’s focus on consumption, the opponent distracts them from the true nature of the game, using age-old tricks that seem too big or too obvious to suspect, yet are effective precisely because of their apparent simplicity and grandeur.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Environmental Control</strong>: A skilled opponent will manipulate the environment to ensure dominance, making it larger and seemingly more complex to handle. This strategy makes it difficult for the victim to see beyond the immediate surroundings that the opponent controls.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Questioning Investment and Intelligence</strong>: When challenged, the victim’s investment — emotional, intellectual, or financial — is called into question, triggering a defensive mechanism that prevents them from accepting the possibility of their own deception.</p>
<p>5. <strong>The Ultimate Deception</strong>: The greatest trick played by the opponent is the psychological warfare that makes the victim identify with the enemy. This deep-rooted deception leads to self-denial until it is too late for the victim to retract.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion: The Psychological Underpinnings of Games and Cons</strong></p>
<p>The intricacies of games and cons reveal much about human nature. Our desires for approval and recognition are often the very hooks that opponents use to control us. By understanding these mechanisms, we can navigate not only games but also the greater challenges of life, turning deception into awareness and manipulation into empowerment.</p>
<p><strong>Some practical ideas from above abstract concepts:</strong></p>
<p>To expand on the practical application of the principles outlined in your text, here are a few additional ideas that can help utilize these rules in everyday situations, enhancing decision-making and strategic thinking:</p>
<p><strong>1. Embrace Challenge Regularly:</strong></p>
<p>— Make it a routine practice to engage with challenges that are slightly above your current skill level, whether in your profession, hobbies, or personal development. This could mean taking on projects that require new skills, playing strategic games against more experienced players, or engaging in debates on topics where you’re not the expert. The key is to consistently stretch your abilities and comfort zones to foster growth. Repetitive practice is beneficial for muscle memory, but mastering cognitive challenges requires tackling increasingly difficult problems. Growth occurs when you engage with unique problems that strain your cognitive capabilities. If solving a problem doesn’t challenge you mentally, you are not improving.</p>
<p><strong>2. Analyze and Reflect:</strong></p>
<p>— After each encounter or challenge, take the time to reflect on what happened, why it happened, and how different strategies could have altered the outcome. This reflective practice can be enhanced by maintaining a journal where you record and analyze your strategic decisions, mistakes, and insights. This will deepen your understanding of both the games you play and your behaviors within them.</p>
<p><strong>3. Study Opponents’ Tactics:</strong></p>
<p>— Spend time learning about successful strategies and tactics used by others in your field or in competitive arenas that interest you. This could involve studying chess games, analyzing business case studies, or reviewing negotiation tactics in historical contexts. Understanding these tactics will not only improve your ability to predict and counter opponents’ moves but also equip you with a broader repertoire of strategies.</p>
<p><strong>4. Mindfulness and Environmental Awareness:</strong></p>
<p>— Develop mindfulness practices that enhance your awareness of your surroundings and internal cues. This heightened awareness can help you better control the environment and detect subtle manipulations or changes, which is crucial in both competitive and cooperative settings.</p>
<p><strong>5. Build Networks of Skilled Individuals:</strong></p>
<p>— Surround yourself with people who are skilled and intelligent in diverse areas. This network will not only provide you with different perspectives and strategies but also create an environment where continuous learning is part of your everyday interactions. The dialogue and exchange within such a network can mimic the dynamics of facing stronger opponents, fostering personal and collective growth.</p>
<p><strong>6. Simulate Scenarios:</strong></p>
<p>— Regularly set up simulations or role-play scenarios that mimic potential real-life situations. This could be as simple as role-playing a negotiation process with a friend or as complex as setting up a business strategy game with colleagues. These simulations can help you practice applying various strategies in a controlled, low-risk environment, allowing you to experiment with and refine your approaches.</p>
<p><strong>7. Learn from Other Domains:</strong></p>
<p>— Often, the best strategies come from unexpected places. Look for strategic insights in areas outside your primary field of interest. For example, military strategies can offer insights into business competition, and sports coaching can provide lessons on team management and resilience.</p>
<p><strong>8. Systems and Outcomes:</strong></p>
<p>— Communism: Typically, systems operating under communist ideologies gravitate towards a state of minimal energy, where individuals perform only the bare minimum required. Over time, management may redefine what constitutes ‘work,’ progressively reducing the effort required. This can lead to a situation where true productivity ceases, and the system deteriorates.</p>
<p>— Capitalism: Often evolves into a plutocracy, characterized by a few influential players manipulating the market from behind the scenes. For instance, companies like OpenAI may proclaim imminent threats to secure funding or push for regulations that suppress competition, aiming to monopolize artificial general intelligence (AGI). Control over AGI equates to control over the future.</p>
<p>— Military AI Development: Promotes a race in automation and innovation, as every player needs to keep up. This escalation could lead to the creation of self-aware machines designed to preserve themselves in conflict, potentially prioritizing their AI counterparts over humans.</p>
<p><strong>9. Navigating Complex Games:</strong></p>
<p>— The complexity of the game (interaction between people, computers, and other systems) increases with more participants, interconnected systems, and extended durations, attracting increasingly intelligent competitors. Whether it’s technical skills, management acumen, business strategy, or political savvy, each level plays a different game.</p>
<p><strong>It’s crucial to recognize the game you’re in and understand its rules — whether at work, home, or in commercial interactions.</strong></p>

            <![CDATA[
                <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>In a fascinating exchange with an ex-military intelligence/sigint person, now a tech consultant during conference lunch, a treasure trove of insights was unveiled (mainly between the lines), offering a glimpse into the complex world of intelligence and security. The discussion not only underscored the subtleties of information gathering and analysis but also provided a broader perspective on how biases and personal incentives can shape the interpretation and dissemination of data. While the conversation touched upon political subjects, the true gem was the analytical mindset and approach to intelligence and information.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:600/1*ckR4wHyUDr097YVwL-_cNg.png" alt="" data-is-external-image="true"></p>
<p><strong>Key Insights</strong></p>
<p><em>1. The Source and Context of Information</em></p>
<p>The primary takeaway from the conversation was the importance of understanding the source and context of information. Identifying who provides the information and the circumstances surrounding its delivery is vital, as it lays the groundwork for any subsequent analysis and ensures that the intelligence is evaluated within the appropriate context. This is particularly visible in geopolitics, where understanding who provides the information and why can significantly impact its interpretation.</p>
<p><em>2. Distinct Roles within Teams</em></p>
<p>There is a clear distinction between intelligence and security teams within the military. While both are essential components of the defense and security framework, their functions and objectives differ significantly. This separation allows for the specialized handling of data and ensures that expertise is applied in the most effective manner.</p>
<p><em>3. The Role of Analysts</em></p>
<p>Analysts play a pivotal role in making sense of the information. They scrutinize who said what and contextualize this within the broader framework of known facts and historical data. Following a thorough analysis, reports are disseminated throughout relevant structures, highlighting key points that require attention.</p>
<p><em>4. The Critical Importance of Motives and Causes</em></p>
<p>Understanding the motive behind the information is as important as the information itself. Analysts must consider why something was said and the potential consequences of this information. This approach helps distinguish between mere data and actionable intelligence. Comprehending the intent of every player or agent in a situation is critical.</p>
<p><em>5. Perception vs. Perspective</em></p>
<p>The discussion emphasized the difference between perception and perspective. While perception refers to one’s interpretation of the current situation, perspective involves understanding it within a larger context, often influenced by incentives, personal history, and affiliations.</p>
<p><em>6. Planning and Commander’s Intent</em></p>
<p>In military strategy, planning based on the adversary’s capabilities rather than intentions is advisable. However, the core of any operation is the commander’s intent — the reason behind the operation — which must remain clear, even if the plans need to adapt to changing circumstances.</p>
<p><em>7. The Four W’s of Information Handling</em></p>
<p>When handling any piece of information, four key aspects must be considered equally:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the message?</li>
<li>Who is passing the message?</li>
<li>What is their intent?</li>
<li>Who benefits from the message?</li>
</ul>
<p>This framework helps analyze information objectively and ensures a logical approach to intelligence handling.</p>
<p><em>8. Bias and Ideological Programming</em></p>
<p>Bias was identified as a significant enemy of logical thinking. It’s crucial to separate data gathering from analysis to avoid biased interpretations. Additionally, ideological programming can create persistent biases, affecting perceived threats and opportunities.</p>
<p><em>9. The Influence of Technology</em></p>
<p>Platforms like Twitter represent advanced modes of control where messages can be highly personalized and targeted. This allows for more control and manipulation based on the recipients’ profiles and predispositions. In contrast, mass media messaging must be modified to suit the least common denominator, while social network media enables highly targeted messaging down to the level of weaponization.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>This enlightening conversation with a retired military intelligence illuminated the intricate dynamics of information handling in security contexts. By understanding the source, context, and intent behind data, professionals can mitigate biases and make informed decisions about military operations, business strategies, and emerging technologies. These insights serve as a valuable guide for navigating the complex landscape of intelligence and decision-making in an ever-changing world.</p>

                <p class="first:mt-1.5">This short essay is inspired by my job in the State Lottery of Serbia between May 2005 and May 2012. In the essay, I tried to summarize how the state lottery's Information System (IS) evolved.</p>
<p class="first:mt-1.5">First steps were manual report generation—the data analyst way. Unfortunately, this wasn’t feasible given the number and frequency of reports. Management wanted to track sales in real time.</p>
<p class="first:mt-1.5">Next, we generated reports against live data. At the time, it seemed like a great idea, but we quickly learned you can’t have both fast inserts (from 1000s of POS machines) and fast queries (needed for reports) on the same database. Every report request from anyone in the building slowed down the data server.</p>
<p class="first:mt-1.5">That’s when we learned why there is wisdom in splitting data access into OLTP and OLAP databases.</p>
<p class="first:mt-1.5">Our second phase was nightly automated data parsing and loading, preparing data for reports. Management still wanted some data in real time, so we implemented what was essentially our own early map-reduce–style pipeline. Real-time data was parsed and handled, and any report requiring real-time info hit very small tables that were updated multiple times per second.</p>
<p class="first:mt-1.5">Over time, these reports and the web pages hosting them spread across the company, and everyone could see everything. Unsurprisingly, top management didn’t love the idea that the coffee lady could check company earnings. The solution was to integrate all these separate pages into a single application with login, permissions, and proper security.</p>
<p class="first:mt-1.5">After integration, we faced an endless stream of requests for additional reports from every corner of the company. In addition to the nightly ETL and report preparation, we also developed new lottery games and integrated our system with external customers. All of this effort just accelerated the proliferation of reports.</p>
<p class="first:mt-1.5">Eventually, top management was saturated with dashboards and conflicting KPIs. The business decision was to focus on a single set of KPIs aligned with company goals, instead of ad hoc metrics defined by each department. This effort created a unified web-based Information System with a standardized set of reports.</p>
<p class="first:mt-1.5">A few years down the line, when sales started declining, Marketing and Sales began requesting reports that could be summarized as “compare everything to everything else” to try to find some light at the end of the tunnel. The only way to tame the explosion was self-service. We used Microsoft DW technology (SSAS and SSIS). With these tools, the dev team finally got ahead of the requests. The data warehouse was prepared nightly; processing took about six hours, with multiple redundancies and consistency checks.</p>
<p class="first:mt-1.5">The downside was that one Excel file became the new information system. Everyone felt in control and could do whatever they wanted. Some entrepreneurial colleagues built their own reports using data from the DW. Suddenly, we were scrambling across the company, trying to keep track of Excel versions.</p>
<p class="first:mt-1.5">After Excel’s introduction, we realized no one was logging into the IS anymore.</p>
<p class="first:mt-1.5">And hilariously, we found ourselves back where we started: the coffee lady complained about her salary after seeing how much money the company earned (while ignoring expenses). Trusting people not to share an Excel file is not a viable approach, even among top management.</p>
<p class="first:mt-1.5">We had to introduce permissions on DW tables to limit who could see what. The situation finally blew up when the CEO sent an Excel file with CEO-level privileges to Payments, and Payments accidentally forwarded the CEO Excel to Sales… and suddenly everyone had CEO-level access.</p>
<p class="first:mt-1.5">All this time, our chief IT guy was a Linux proponent, while the company ran Windows clients and a mix of Windows and Linux servers.</p>
<p class="first:mt-1.5">The Excel debacle was the final straw that gave the development team enough ammunition to push IT to adopt Active Directory. Introducing AD resolved the chaos around permissions and privileges. Suddenly, there was no need to log in to the IS; anyone could open any approved Excel file, and it worked out of the box.</p>
<p class="first:mt-1.5">It was a wild time. We were solving problems on the fly as systems ran and a 7-million-strong audience played games. There was no appetite to stop everything for a few days to roll out a new system; the only way to pause for a few hours was in the face of a significant crisis or breakdown.</p>
<p>Talking with a bunch of friends, it turned out that the observed sequence: manual → live on OLTP → split OLTP/OLAP → hybrid near-real-time → app consolidation → Excel self-service on SSAS → central IAM (AD), was similar to how many companies evolved in 2005–2012.</p>
<p class="first:mt-1.5">Today, most of this system could be implemented by one person, and all reporting could be handled with Power BI, Tableau, Qlik, or similar tools.</p>
