title: About me
subtitle: Decision systems, product intelligence, and complex systems
---

My name is **Slobodan Ninkov**.  
I work on **decision systems and product intelligence** for complex, data-rich products.

I design **decision-grade analytics, models, and feedback systems** that help teams make high-stakes product decisions under uncertainty. My work sits between **product management, data science, and systems analysis**, with a strong focus on how decisions are actually made in real organizations.



## What I work on

I focus on problems where dashboards alone are not enough:

- **Decision support and product intelligence**
- **Product and operational analytics tied to real decisions**
- **Data and system modeling for complex behavior**
- **Evaluation and monitoring of AI-enabled systems**
- **Uncertainty, drift, and failure-mode analysis**

The goal is not reporting, but **better decisions under real-world constraints**.



## How I approach problems

My approach is shaped by systems thinking and engineering practice:

- Analytics exists to **constrain and inform decisions**, not decorate them
- Metrics must map to **specific actions and owners**
- Models are useful only if their assumptions and limits are explicit
- Uncertainty should be exposed, not hidden
- If a metric can be gamed, it eventually will

I treat dashboards, models, and analyses as **interfaces between complex systems and human judgment**.



## Background

I come from a **technical and systems background**, which influences how I think about product and data work: I pay close attention to data generation, feedback loops, incentives, and failure modes. This helps avoid common traps such as misleading KPIs, overconfident models, and analytics disconnected from actual product decisions.



## What I’m interested in

- Decision systems and product intelligence roles
- Product analytics combined with modeling and evaluation
- Work on complex or AI-enabled systems where uncertainty matters
- Environments that value judgment, clarity, and accountability

If the problem involves **making better decisions in complex systems**, this is where I do my best work.
