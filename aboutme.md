## Slobodan Ninkov
  
I solve technical problems end-to-end — from system design through field deployment.  
For over twenty years, I've built systems where failure isn't an option: IoT sensor networks, real-time data pipelines, airborne intelligence platforms, and simulation systems that replaced 95% of physical field testing.  Two patents. Work spanning distributed systems, embedded devices, and mission-critical operations.  
  
#What I do  
  
I design, prototype, and deploy systems that interact with the real world:  
  
* Sensor networks and edge devices at scale  
* Real-time data pipelines and anomaly detection  
* Simulation and digital twins that reduce costly field testing  
* System integration across hardware, software, and operations  
  
The goal is systems that actually work under real conditions — not just in demos or design reviews.  
  
#How I work  
  
* Start from the problem, not the technology  
* Prototype early, test in the field, iterate  
* Keep complexity where it earns its keep  
* Design for failure modes, edge cases, and drift  
* Prefer small teams with clear ownership over process-heavy coordination  
  
I work best with high autonomy on real problems where outcomes matter more than appearances.  
  
#Background  
  
My path: software development → system architecture → technical product management. The thread through all of it: building systems that have to work reliably in unpredictable environments.  
I've led cross-functional R&D teams, defined product roadmaps, and shipped production systems across defense-adjacent, telecommunications, and regulated industries. But what I do best — and prefer — is the technical work itself.  
  
#Currently  
  
MSc in Cognitive Systems (Open University of Cyprus, 2026) — focused on simulation and AI-physics integration.  
  
#Interested in  
  
* Technical roles with end-to-end ownership  
* Small teams, real problems, minimal process theater  
* Simulation, IoT, real-time systems, sensor fusion  
* Environments where the system has to actually work
