title: About me
subtitle: Decision support, product analytics, and systems thinking
---

My name is **Slobodan Ninkov**.  
I work at the intersection of **product analytics, decision support, and complex systems**.

I design **decision-grade analytics and feedback systems** that help teams make high-stakes product decisions under uncertainty. My focus is not on reporting or vanity metrics, but on **separating signal from noise**, aligning metrics with real decisions, and preventing **AI- and KPI-driven self-deception**.


## What I actually do

- Design **product and operational metrics** that map directly to decisions
- Build **dashboards as control surfaces**, not presentation artifacts
- Translate messy system behavior into **actionable insights**
- Evaluate and monitor **AI-enabled systems** with an emphasis on uncertainty, drift, and failure modes
- Challenge misleading metrics before they harden into bad decisions

I care less about tools and more about **judgment, incentives, and feedback loops**.


## How I think about analytics

- Analytics exists to **constrain decisions**, not decorate them
- Every metric must have a **clear owner and a clear action**
- If a metric can be gamed, it eventually will
- Uncertainty should be surfaced, not hidden
- When data and intuition disagree, both need scrutiny


## Background (brief and relevant)

I come from a **systems and engineering background**, which shapes how I approach analytics: I pay attention to data generation, failure modes, and real-world constraints. This helps me avoid the common trap of building dashboards that look correct but misrepresent reality.


## What I’m interested in

- Decision support and product analytics roles
- Analytics for complex, AI-enabled, or safety-critical systems
- Work where metrics directly influence product and operational outcomes

If the goal is to make **better decisions under uncertainty**, we’ll probably get along.
