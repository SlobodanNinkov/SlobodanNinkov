title: About me
subtitle: Analytics engineering, product analytics, and decision-ready data
---

My name is **Slobodan Ninkov**.

I work as an **analytics engineer** focused on building reliable data models, metrics, and analytical foundations that support **product and operational decision-making** in complex, data-rich products.

My work sits close to engineering, but is strongly informed by **product thinking**: understanding user behavior, system constraints, and the trade-offs behind real product decisions. The goal is to ensure teams are working from data that reflects reality, not just activity.



## What I work on

I focus on areas where product decisions depend on data being correct, consistent, and interpretable:

- Analytics engineering and data modeling (facts, dimensions, events)
- Product and operational metrics with clear definitions and ownership
- Semantic layers that keep teams aligned on “what the numbers mean”
- Data quality, validation, and early detection of issues
- Supporting product discovery, experimentation, and evaluation with trustworthy data

The goal is not reporting for reporting’s sake, but **analytics that product teams can confidently act on**.



## How I approach problems

My approach combines product awareness with engineering discipline:

- Start from the **decision or question**, then design the data backward
- Define data grain and metric meaning before building dashboards
- Keep business logic versioned and reviewable, not hidden in tools
- Treat metrics as part of the product contract, not just internal KPIs
- Assume data and usage patterns will change, and design for that

I treat analytics as a **core product capability**, not a supporting afterthought.



## Background

I come from a **technical and systems-oriented background**, with experience on complex and safety-sensitive products. This shapes how I approach product analytics: I pay close attention to how data is generated, how incentives influence behavior, and where systems tend to fail under real conditions.

This helps avoid common traps such as misleading KPIs, overconfident interpretations, and analytics that look correct but don’t hold up when decisions matter.



## What I’m interested in

- Analytics engineering roles with strong product collaboration  
- Product analytics built on solid data foundations  
- Data work that directly supports prioritization, discovery, and delivery  
- Environments that value clarity, correctness, and accountability over volume of output  

If the goal is to make **better product decisions with data teams can trust**, that’s where I do my best work.
