Context: I tried to build a startup based on “simulated field usage and testing”. The need is real: in product development with field testing, simulation can be far cheaper than running systems in the field.

This experience strongly influenced how I think about analytics and data work today: clarity beats cleverness, incentives shape behavior more than intent, and systems fail at their boundaries, not their centers.  


What I learned:



## Paperwork is real

Starting, running, and closing a company means lawyers, auditors, and filings.

They’re friendly—but they get paid whether you sink or swim. Budget for their services. As a limited company, expect at least annual director responsibilities and audits.



## Be clear: product or service

Product = you sell a thing. Service = you sell time/knowledge. I tried “product with customization.” It muddied the message and confused customers.



## The EU favors products

Services don’t scale easily; policy and incentives often lean toward product companies.



## GDPR is not optional

If your site has logins, you’re under GDPR. Competitors may report you. Compliance and cybersecurity are real costs and responsibilities—almost a separate business function.



## Anything near defense has its own gravity

Different rules, long procurement cycles, and relationship-driven. The system favors big, slow incumbents. Connections matter.



## Distribution beats almost everything

If you crack marketing and sales, you can rent development and still build a product.



## TAM isn’t what you think

Your “imagined” market and your “accessible” market are different. Validate the reachable slice.



## Technical excellence ≠ traction

Without sales and marketing, craftsmanship doesn’t move the needle.



!!! Important takeaways:

## Nail the product messaging. Clear > clever.

## Make the value obvious to people who aren’t already problem-aware. “This is how we do things” inertia is your real competitor.



If you’re working on something similar (simulation, field testing, regulated markets), I'd be happy to compare notes.
