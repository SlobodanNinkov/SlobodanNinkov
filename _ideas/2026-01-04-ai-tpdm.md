## AI is pushing product toward a more model‑driven, simulation, CAD‑like workflow.  
  
Dual-track is becoming the norm:  
🔍 🌟 Discovery: fast, AI-heavy prototyping, simulation, and evaluation.  
  
🖥 🚚 Delivery: gated engineering, reliability, safety, cost/perf, and controlled rollout.  
  
These cycles should be loosely coupled with explicit integration checkpoints (data, security, latency/cost).
