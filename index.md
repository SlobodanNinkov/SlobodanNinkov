I solve technical problems end-to-end — from system design through field deployment.

20+ years building mission-critical systems: IoT sensor networks processing millions of daily transactions, airborne intelligence platforms, and simulation systems that eliminated 95% of physical testing. Two patents in mobile location systems.
  
## What I Build

Systems that work under real conditions — not just in demos.

**Sensor Networks at Scale**
Led a €2M+ IoT sensor network from proof-of-concept to multi-territory production deployment. 10-person cross-functional team. Mission-critical reliability requirements.

**Simulation & Digital Twins**
Built a proprietary drone simulation platform that replaced 95% of physical flight testing — later commercialized as a $200K standalone product.

**Real-Time Data Pipelines**
Architected high-throughput systems handling €50M+ annual transaction volume and 1M+ daily transactions, with integrated fraud detection and anomaly detection.

**Hardware-Software Integration**
Drove €3M+ in hardware sales through development and integration of complex airborne and cyber-intelligence products. Full lifecycle ownership from architecture through field operations.


## How I Work

- Start from the problem, not the technology
- Prototype early, test in the field, iterate
- Design for failure modes, edge cases, and drift
- Keep complexity where it earns its keep
- Small teams with clear ownership over process theater

I work best with high autonomy on real problems where outcomes matter more than appearances.

## Background

**Path:** Software Development → System Architecture → Technical Product Management

The thread: building systems that must work reliably in unpredictable environments.

**Current:**  
Technical Product Manager at GSMK (secure communications), Berlin — 7 years leading mission-critical IoT and real-time systems.  

**Previous:**  
Owner at SN Terra Cognitive LTD - flight simulation and training systems.
Product Owner at UTX Technologies — airborne platforms, simulation systems, cyber-intelligence products.  
Software Architect at State Lottery of Serbia — high-throughput transaction systems, fraud detection, regulatory compliance.  
Senior Software Engineer at LegisStream - documentation support system.



## Looking For

- Technical roles with end-to-end system ownership
- Simulation, IoT, real-time systems, sensor fusion, anomaly detection
- Small teams, real problems, high autonomy
- Environments where the system has to actually work

**Location:** Berlin-based. Open to relocation (UAE, Singapore) or remote roles with travel.
