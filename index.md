&nbsp;       I solve technical problems end-to-end — from system design through field deployment. For over twenty years, I’ve built systems where failure isn’t an option.

&nbsp;   </div>

&nbsp;   <p>Two patents. Work spanning distributed systems, embedded devices, and mission-critical operations. My experience includes IoT sensor networks, real-time data pipelines, airborne intelligence platforms, and simulation systems that replaced 95% of physical field testing.</p>

&nbsp;       <h2>What I Do</h2>

&nbsp;       <p>I design, prototype, and deploy systems that interact with the real world:</p>

&nbsp;       <br>

&nbsp;       <ul>

&nbsp;           <li>Sensor networks and edge devices at scale</li>

&nbsp;           <li>Real-time data pipelines and anomaly detection</li>

&nbsp;           <li>Simulation and digital twins that reduce field testing</li>

&nbsp;           <li>System integration across hardware and software</li>

&nbsp;       </ul>

&nbsp;   </section>

&nbsp;       <h2>How I Work</h2>

&nbsp;       <ul>

&nbsp;           <li>Start from the problem, not the technology</li>

&nbsp;           <li>Prototype early, test in the field, iterate</li>

&nbsp;           <li>Design for failure modes and edge cases</li>

&nbsp;           <li>Prefer small teams with clear ownership</li>

&nbsp;       </ul>

&nbsp;   <h2>Background</h2>

&nbsp;   <p>My path: software development → system architecture → technical product management. The thread through all of it: building systems that work reliably in unpredictable environments. I’ve led cross-functional R\&D teams and shipped production systems across defense-adjacent, telecommunications, and regulated industries. I prioritize the technical work that ensures a system actually works.</p>

&nbsp;   <h2>Inquiries</h2>

&nbsp;   <p>I am interested in technical roles with end-to-end ownership in environments where outcomes matter more than appearances. I focus on IoT, simulation, and real-time systems where reliability is a requirement, not an afterthought.</p>
