# Slobodan Ninkov

I solve technical problems end-to-end — from system design through field deployment.
20+ years building mission-critical systems: IoT sensor networks, real-time data pipelines, airborne platforms, simulation systems that replaced 95% of physical testing. Two patents. Comfortable with system prototyping, development, and field testing/operations.
I work best with high autonomy in small teams on real problems where the system has to actually work — not just pass review.
Currently pursuing MSc in Cognitive Systems (2026) — focused on simulation and AI-physics integration.
