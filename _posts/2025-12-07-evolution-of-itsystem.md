# Evolution of an Information System (2005–2012)

*By Slobodan Ninkov*  
*Posted on December 7, 2025*

This short essay reflects on how a large, real-time transactional system evolved its reporting and analytics stack between 2005 and 2012, based on my work at the State Lottery of Serbia.

While the technologies have changed significantly since then, the **failure modes, trade-offs, and organizational dynamics** described here remain largely the same today.
