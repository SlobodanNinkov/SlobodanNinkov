I solve technical problems end-to-end — from system design through field deployment.  
For over twenty years, I've built systems where failure isn't an option: IoT sensor networks, real-time data pipelines, airborne intelligence platforms, and simulation systems that replaced 95% of physical field testing. Two patents. Work spanning distributed systems, embedded devices, and mission-critical operations.
